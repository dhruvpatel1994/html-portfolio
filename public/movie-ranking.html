<h1>The Best Movies According to Dhruv.</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>This movie really shaped how I saw the world. Everything is not as it seems and often times, if you are not living intentionally, someone will try to make use of your time for you, and you won't like the results</p>

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>The movie was visually stunning even all the way back in 2009. It has a basic enough story, but really it was just so striking and memorable.</p>

<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>The first Iron Man movie was so awesome. It was so cool to see someone be so competent at what they do and totally own who they are. Robert Downey's performance is honestly what carries all the MCU. It's fitting that when he died, Marvel died with him.</p>
